## Application Description
Order Up is a native application that allows for restaurants to streamline the ordering experience for their customers and staff.
Managers can edit the menu through administrative rights. Customers/servers can swipe through menu options and add/edit food options to an order. Users can check price and item descriptions. The food items (menu assets) can be changed dynamicalls through a connected database. 

## ScreenShots
This is the primary screen where customers and servers are able to see the existing menu options and place an order.

## Future Plans for Development
This application meets all set requirements as dictated above. If we were to work further on this application there would be numerous things that could be done to finish the application:
- The UI would require a dynamic styling that can easily meet the preferences for any potential restaurant
- The addition of completed pages with differing functionality depending on the user type
- More customizable options for different user types and menu additions (such as customizing particular orders)
